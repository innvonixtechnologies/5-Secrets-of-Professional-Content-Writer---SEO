# 5-Secrets-of-Professional-Content-Writer---SEO

As a content writer, I am pretty sure that one of your main goals is to make your readers happy. You would want to put smile on their faces and you want them to remember what you've written for a very long time. 

Know your readers. Before you choose the topics for your articles, I suggest that you find ways to get to know the people that you're writing for first. You will not be able to make your articles effective and impacting unless you know what these people are looking for. Interview some of them and get an idea about their problems, their goals in life, their most frequent questions, their preferences, and their levels of comprehension. The more you know about your readers, the better your chances of getting through to them. You can make this happen by simply following these tips:

<h2>Secrets of Professional Content Writer</h2>

<b>Choose your topics</b> - There are basically two questions that you need to ask yourself when choosing your topics. These are "Is it useful/interesting to my readers?" and "Is it something that will serve my purpose?" If you're somebody who's offering luxury bags for example, you must stick with topics that will allow you to give your readers the kind of information they need about luxury bags and those topics that will help you showcase your expertise in this niche so you can easily earn the trust and confidence of your potential buyers.

<b>Create an outline</b> - This is the secret to writing a very coherent article or web content. Before you start tapping on your keyboard, create a skeleton for your articles first. Start by listing the information that you'll be including in your content. Through this, you'll know right away what direction you'll be heading and you'll know that you will not get lost along the way.

<b>Write simply</b> - There is no need to make your articles/web content confusing. Your readers will surely appreciate it if you help them in easily getting the ideas that you're trying to get across. Write your articles as if you're writing for a 10th grader. Use the simplest terms and make your sentences relatively short. If you need to use highly technical terms or acronyms, make sure that you explain them as you use them in your content.

<b>Keep it short and meaty</b> -  Avoid wasting the time of your readers. Communicate all the information you have in a very straightforward manner. This way, you can make sure that your articles will not contain more than 800 words. Exclude fillers and nonsense sentences. Ensure that every part of your content is worth reading.

<b>Proofread</b> - I know you would like to give your audience great reading experience. So, proofread your web content or articles before you make them available in the online arena. Ensure that they're free from run-on sentences, confusing paragraphs, and spelling/grammar errors.
